[Part 1 of this series](https://und3rf10w.github.io/posts/2022/01/08/shlyuz-1-influences.html) dove into the influences of Shlyuz. This part will dive into the Shlyuz architecture.

Shlyuz consists of 3 primary different components:

> Teamserver
> Listening Post
> Implant

There are additional unimplemented components like the console and builder, but these are not needed for Shlyuz to function.
